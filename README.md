## Getting Started

### Adding the library

In your project level gradle, add:
```
    maven { url "http://jitpack.io" }
```

In your app level gradle **(4.0+)**, add:
```
    implementation 'com.github.talhahasanzia:anaclock:0.1'
```
for gradle versions **below 4.0** use:
```
    compile 'com.github.talhahasanzia:anaclock:0.1'
```
## Using in your project
- Based on View class of android, this AnaClock will serve as skeleton for building custom analog clocks, stop watches or timer views.
- If you want to use this view in its simplest form, just add the view in your xml and provide attributes for seconds, minutes and hours styling.
- If you want to create your own skin, you can extend this class to make your own drawings while reusing most of the logic.
- Currently drawing is based on simple lines.
- Most of the methods are protected, so to develop a skin over this you may extend this class and override methods.



## Contributing

- Contributions are welcomed as long as they dont break the code. Please create an issue and have a discussion before pull request.
- There is still WIP so dont hesitate to report issues or pull requests.
- Also, if you created a skin based on this library you can create a pull request and we will add it in official release.
